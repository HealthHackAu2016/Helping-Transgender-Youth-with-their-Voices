# Description

Having a voice that does not match oneâ€™s gender identity can cause significant distress for transgender individuals, especially during puberty when the voice can change.

Transgender health professionals can assist with this in several ways, including the use of voice training and hormonal interventions.

We would like to develop an app that assists transgender youth attain and maintain a voice which is congruent with their gender identity.

# Two ideas for projects that can be done in 48 hours:
* An app that will track vocal range (pitch and volume) over time to monitor pubertal changes and to monitor the effects of interventions.
* A game that will provide a fun experience that helps the user practice modulating the quality of their voice to achieve the goal of a gender congruent voice.
